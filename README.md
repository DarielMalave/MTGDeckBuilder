# MTGDeckBuilderDraft
The original version of MTG Deck Builder using HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript (+ jQuery), PHP, and MySQL. Full, final version is located at the MTGDeckBuilderReact repository.

I started off this project using vanilla JavaScript, but eventually after weeks of work I find myself getting disorganized and confusing with my file structure.
I eventually picked up React and decided to rebuild this app on React to practice front-end development and I'm glad I made the transition. Full, final version
of MTGDeckBuilder is located at my MTGDeckBuilderReact repository.
